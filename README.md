# Project | Run Out - save the pig!

<br>

## Introduction

Develop a basic game for the browser (only for desktop) to train DOM manipulation, Vanila Javascript classes and objects, HTML and CSS animations, etc. 

<br>

The game consists in saving the pig from the butcher. 
Dodge the knives thrown from the sky, while collecting all the fruits in the field. 

**The game rules:**

- The player is the pig
- When the game starts, the butcher will start follow the pig. 
- The butcher will throw knives to the pig trying to kill him. 
- We don't want the pig to die so our objective it's to save him.
- The pig wins when he arrives to the end having collected all fruits and being still alive.

**The game controls:**

- We control the player with the controls:
- - Right arrow to move forward
- - Left arriw to move backwards
- - Space bar to jump


## Requirements

- Google Chrome
- Desktop size in the browser

**Happy playing!!!** ðŸ’™
